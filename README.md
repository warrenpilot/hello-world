# hello-world
My first repository

OK, so let's see if this can be a good place to start planning what projects I want to do with WarrenPilot.  The first of course is to create a app based on comparing organic growth to future projections.

This looks like it is working well as a place to write stuff down.

So I can edit from my laptop as well.

So you have to create a branch before editing.  Then commit.

This commit is to be on this branch (which I create/switch to first), edit this file, then commit to origin.

Now this branch is strictly for editing before placed into the master.
